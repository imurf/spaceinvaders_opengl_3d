1 - implement the vector2, transforms, and matrix classes - the idea is that transforms will provide
an easy to use interface to store positions and rotations, as well as modify them. Want to store
the rotation part and the translation part seperate in the transforms. Can then give all actors a
transform rather than seperate position, and rotation angles. Will then have a seperate matrix
class that can be constructed from a transform (2d and 3d). The seperate matrix class will provide
opengl compatibility - so will have a flatten function so it can be loaded directly into opengl.
